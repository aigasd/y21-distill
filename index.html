          <p class="main-intro">As we come of age in our 21st year, with a world of information at our fingertips and countless ways to communicate, we are challenged to extract quality from quantity, to create meaning and relevance from clutter. Words, images, ideas, emotions, opinions and responsibilities greet and inspire us each day. As designers, developers, illustrators, writers, artists, scientists and musicians alike, we seek to DISTILL information into a more clear and concise form. From inspiration to execution, how we uniquely process, filter and refine determines the outcome.</p>

Our “Shops” are small intimate sessions limited to 25 people or less. Thinkshops are on Friday, and Workshops are on Saturday. There is no additional fee to participate in either.</p>

          <p class="speaker-bio">Thomas D. Albright is Professor and Conrad T. Prebys Chair at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, where he joined the faculty in 1986. He is also Director of the Salk Institute Center for the Neurobiology of Vision and Adjunct Professor of Psychology and Neurosciences at the University of California, San Diego. Albright is an authority on the neural basis of visual perception, memory and visually guided behavior. His laboratory seeks to understand how visual perception is affected by attention, behavioral goals, and memories of previous experiences. An important goal of this work is the development of therapies for blindness and perceptual impairments resulting from disease, trauma or developmental disorders of the brain. A second aim of Dr. Albright’s work is to use our growing knowledge of brain, perception and memory to inform design in architecture and the arts, and to leverage societal decisions and public policy. Albright received a Ph.D. in psychology and neuroscience from Princeton University. He is a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and an associate of the Neuroscience Research Program.

          <h6 class="modal-presenter-name">About Skye Walker</h6>
          <p class="presenter-bio">Skye Walker was born in Big Bear, California in 1978. His parents, Morris and Lynn Walker were musicians, entertainers and artists. The Walker family, including Skye’s younger sister Amoris moved all over the country from California to Nevada to Hawaii to Colorado to Oregon. His parents enjoyed travel and adventure and experiencing new places with the kids.</p>
          <p class="presenter-bio">When Skye and Amoris were old enough, Morris took the family on the road as the EarthWalkers, a family band with a message for preserving the environment using bluegrass music and comedy to bring home the message. They traveled all over the United States performing for schools, colleges entertaining thousands of kids and adults alike. Morris played guitar, Skye played banjo while Lynn and Amoris sang all the while mixing humor into the show to keep the audience laughing and having fun while talking about pollution and keeping America beautiful.</p>
          <p class="presenter-bio">They logged over 2,000 shows in three years nationwide. Skye and Amoris were home schooled during that time and their parents encouraged their creativity with art, writing and music.</p>
          <p class="presenter-bio">Once the EarthWalkers finished touring, they moved to Oregon. Throughout all their travels Skye remained focused on art. This led him to a pre-college visual arts program called JumpstART at Oregon State University which he attended for two summers and earned a four year art scholarship to Oregon State University. Through college Skye did a lot of various commercial art projects including lots of murals on campus. Skye’s father, Morris, taught him about lettering and how to do murals when he was in high school. Morris had been a sign painter in the 70’s and early 80’s and had done a fair amount of murals as well. He wanted to pass this knowledge down to Skye so he could use it to his benefit.</p>
          <p class="presenter-bio">While he loved murals, he focused on fine art and then transitioned to Graphic Design at OSU. Skye received a BFA in Graphic Design in 2001, packed his bags and surfboards and moved back to Southern California and headed straight to Encinitas. He’d been in and out of Encinitas his whole life and he knew he wanted to live there so he could surf as much as possible.</p>
          <p class="presenter-bio">Throughout Skye’s professional career he’s worked in-house and on a contract basis for companies such as: Rip Curl, Redsand, prAna, Dragon, Nike, Liquid Force, UCLA Athletics and more. In 2011 Whole Foods contacted Skye about doing murals for their new Encinitas store, needless to say he was elated and it kickstarted his passion for murals and large format art again.</p>
          <p class="presenter-bio">Since then, Skye has created original commercial murals for Whole Foods, California Coast Credit Union, The Cardinal Group, Mesa Rim, Farm Lab, Royal Liquor and many more.</p>
          <p class="presenter-bio">Since then, Skye has created original commercial murals for Whole Foods, California Coast Credit Union, The Cardinal Group, Mesa Rim, Farm Lab, Royal Liquor and many more.</p>
          <p class="presenter-bio">Having a strong graphic design and fine art background helps Skye to work with clients to create original murals that meld with the themes of the company or project. Skye loves to paint murals that are just of his own vision, but he equally loves the challenge of creating permanent large scale murals and installations for clients who usually have a lot they want to convey.</p>
          <p class="presenter-bio">Travel is a big part of being a commercial muralist and Skye has created murals in California, Oregon, Arizona, Colorado and Texas, with his sights set on doing murals anywhere and everywhere he can.</p>
          <p class="presenter-bio">Going forward Skye’s goal is to do as many mural projects as possible within California and beyond. He believes it’s a great way to bring something special to any community or business and also raise awareness about the importance of art in our daily lives.</p>

          <p class="presenter-bio">Tim Butler is a masterpiece. Some call him the old, grizzled one around the press because of his vast knowledge and experience, and he takes that as task to continue to teach the lessons he learned from the craftsmen he spent so many hours with growing up. It’s not so much about the final product as it is the process; Tim is in it for the collaboration and the machinery. He believes when work becomes play, we’ve truly made this life what it’s meant to be.</p>
          <p class="presenter-bio">As a San Diego native, Tim has been around the creative and music scene for longer than he likes to admit, and takes genuine pride in what he creates in all ways creative.

          <p class="shop-description">Workshop participants will build Birdhouses from homeless signs and other materials provided. While we work, we’ll brainstorm new ideas about how to use concepts similar to the Birdhouses to raise awareness of other issues and generate funds to address them. Participants will be able to take their birdhouse home and use it as a reminder to design for good.</p>
          <p class="shop-description">The homeless make signs to tell their story, ask for help and make themselves be seen, if only for a moment, at a traffic light or on a street corner. Their messages are many and their sentiments are heartfelt. Their signs serve as business cards, personal signage and an advertisement for their cause. Since 2003, Ken has been buying their signs and creating art with them by building a series of Birdhouses using the signs as roof shingles—a temporary shelter with an indelible message. The goal is to bring attention to the homeless condition by moving their message to galleries and living rooms and generate funds for programs that assist homeless individuals and families. A few birdhouses have already been sold with the profits donated to Alpha Project, a San Diego based homeless outreach program.</p>

        <p class="design-leader-bio">86% of professional designers are Caucasian. The lack of diversity in our profession is more than just a number. It goes beyond race to include ethnicity, religion, age, gender, sexual identity and ability/disability. The lack of diverse role models, public awareness and need for equal opportunity impacts the future. How can educators and designers ensure that our professions reflect and honor the lives of all people? If we’re all in this together and determined to make change, how do we get started?</p>
